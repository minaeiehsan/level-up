# Level Up Program

> _Background: This program has started as part of my personal development, later on it was used for onboarding new joiners to my teams. also, had a chance to share a customized version of it with other [companies](https://github.com/minaeiehsan/level-up/blob/main/companies.md)._

- _**Pragmatic**_ approach on
  - Algorithms and it's applications: [sample material](./samples/algorithms-applications.md)
  - Clean and testable code: [sample code kata](./samples/code-kata.md)
  - Just enough architecture and structure: [sample architecture kata](./samples/architecture-kata.md)
  - Software engineer best practices and survey of common trade off: [sample improvement path](./samples/improvement-path.md)
  - Better understanding of scaling challenges (Related to team and organization and also distributed systems)
- [Part I: Code](#part-i-code)
- [Part II: Design](#part-ii-design)
- [Part III: 360ยบ Scale](#part-iii-360ยบ-scale)

# Part I: Code

- **Prerequisite**: Average level of writing code in your favorite language
- **Goal**: Improve problem solving skills and write more readable code, Making sense of algorithm
- **Program Focus**: 30%
- **Details**
  - Guidelines being applied to lines of code within functions or classes (language mechanic) and making them easy to understand.
  - Explain the core concepts and techniques.
  - Solve coding challenges.
- **Workshops**
  - Read a few selective chapters from classic computer science books.
  - Refactoring Kata
- **Resources**
  - In-detail explanation and combination between algorithms and applications in life. Not only do you know how to construct algorithms

# Part II: Design

- **Prerequisite**: Experience of building commercial applications
- **Goal**: Improve software design and architecture
- **Program Focus**: 50%
- **Details**
  - _**TED**_
    - **T**est driven development
    - **E**vent driven architecture
    - **D**omain driven Design
- **Sample demonstration projects**
  - [Typescript](https://github.com/minaeiehsan/level-up-ts)

  - [PHP](https://github.com/minaeiehsan/level-up-php)
  - [Go](https://github.com/minaeiehsan/level-up-go)
- **Workshops**
  - Extend current sample projects or implement similar project in your favorite language with same practices.
  - Implement new functionality by _**TED**_ mindset on top of project.
  - Architecture Kata

# Part III: 360ยบ Scale

- **Prerequisite**: Experience of working as a part TEAM(s)!
- **Goal**: Ability to work in more complex environments
- **Program Focus**: 20%
- **Detail**
  - Conceptual model and event storming
  - Agile and team topology
  - Observability
  - Optimal path for scale
  - Distributed system essentials
  - Application/Service level concerns for production
  - Engineering decisions about local, staging and production environments with the observability. Where the data is stored and how it is accessed. Thinking out of a single service.
  - Tools 101: Docker, K8s, Terraform, ...
- **Workshops**
  - Design a conceptual model for a complex application
  - Package a simple service for production
  - Select and implement a pattern from program for dealing with failure and make your service more resilience
